# Disease-Prediction-System
To create a Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning, follow these structured steps, incorporating Python code for each phase of the project.
1. Data Collection
Gather a diverse dataset containing relevant health features such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family medical history. You can use publicly available datasets like the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Selection
Use techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance from tree-based models to select influential variables.
4. Model Implementation
Implement various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implement cross-validation to assess generalization performance.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
7. Model Interpretability
Use SHAP values or feature importance plots to enhance model interpretability.
8. User Interface Development
Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit or Flask to allow users to input health-related data.
This structured approach provides a comprehensive framework for developing a Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning in Python.
